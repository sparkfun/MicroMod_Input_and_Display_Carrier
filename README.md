The SparkFun MicroMod Input and Display Carrier Board is a great way to add data and input visibility to your MicroMod project. Want to create your own embedded game? How about displaying data that is remotely collected and transmitted by your SparkFun MicroMod Weather Carrier Board and its processor? This is a great option. 

This carrier board combines a 2.4" TFT display, 6 addressable LEDs, onboard voltage regulator, a 6 pin IO connector, and microSD slot with the M.2 pin connector slot so that it can be used with compatible processor boards in our MicroMod ecosystem.
